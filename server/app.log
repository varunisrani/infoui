The glossy, toasted brioche bun halves hover apart, their buttery sheen catching dramatic rim lighting. Between them, a thick, juicy Angus beef patty radiates charred grill marks and molten cheddar cheese oozes in slow-motion rivulets. Crisp layers of emerald lettuce, ruby-red tomato slices, and sharp white onion rings cascade downward, accompanied by droplets of smoky barbecue sauce and tangy mustard seeds suspended mid-air. Flickers of cracked black pepper and sea salt crystals shimmer like tiny stars around the composition. A spiral of golden, hand-cut fries arcs gracefully through the scene, their crispy edges catching the light. The entire assembly pulses with savory warmth and indulgent texture, inviting viewers to savor every layered moment. The shot balances rustic authenticity with modern culinary artistry, perfect for bold, textured typography with strong weight and structured hierarchy.

A soft, toasted brioche bun hovers effortlessly, split open at a dramatic angle to reveal the luscious layers within. The centerpiece: a thick, perfectly seared Angus beef patty, its juicy surface glistening with rendered fat and a subtle smoke kiss. Melted aged cheddar cascades off the edge, pooling into molten golden rivulets. Crisp, emerald arugula leaves fan out dynamically, interspersed with vibrant ruby red tomato slices and thin rings of caramelized red onion, their glossy sheen catching the light. A smear of tangy house-made aioli blends seamlessly with a swipe of smoky chipotle ketchup, both caught mid-splash, adding vibrant contrast and richness. Golden, hand-cut fries spiral upward in a playful motion, dusted with a sprinkle of flaky sea salt and cracked black pepper. Nearby, a miniature cast-iron skillet flips, sending sizzling bacon strips and a burst of smoky paprika-infused oil droplets into the air. Captured with razor-sharp clarity and punctuated by deep shadows and sharp highlights, this image elevates the classic cheeseburger into a sensorial feast—bold, indulgent, and irresistibly modern.

A soft, toasted pretzel roll floats weightlessly, dramatically angled to expose its sumptuous layers. The star: thick slices of tender, slow-smoked brisket, their marbled texture glistening with rendered fat and a smoky mahogany crust. A generous smear of creamy horseradish aioli contrasts sharply with a tangy, house-made BBQ sauce that drips in mid-air, rich and luscious. Crisp, emerald baby kale leaves and vibrant ruby pickled red cabbage shards fan outward dynamically, mingling with thin ribbons of caramelized shallots and a scatter of toasted sesame seeds. Golden, hand-cut sweet potato fries curl upward playfully, lightly dusted with smoked paprika and flaky sea salt. Nearby, a miniature cast-iron skillet spins, sending sizzling bacon lardons and bursts of crackling rendered fat into the surrounding space. Captured with razor-sharp precision and punctuated by deep shadows and glistening highlights, this image elevates the classic brisket sandwich into a sensory spectacle—bold, indulgent, and unmistakably modern.

Juicy, thick slices of vine-ripened heirloom tomato and crisp, peppery arugula fan out dynamically, interspersed with thin ribbons of house-pickled red onions that shimmer with a subtle sheen. A generous smear of smoky chipotle aioli and a drizzle of honey mustard sauce cascade mid-air, adding warmth and a balancing tang.

The golden-brown crust peeks out beneath the thick, silky cream cheese layer, crowned by a glossy, ruby-red strawberry compote that slowly drips down the side. Delicate swirls of whipped cream frame the slice, intertwined with scattered fresh mint leaves and a dusting of powdered sugar that sparkles subtly. The background is a muted slate gray, emphasizing the vibrant reds and warm neutrals of the cheesecake. The scene is minimalistic yet luxurious, evoking indulgence and classic New York elegance.

2025-05-27 06:44:37,946 - INFO -   This SVG features a rich, deep teal background created with a smooth radial gradient that fades from a medium teal (#1f4847) in the center to a darker shade (#0a2a2a) at the edges. This gives the design a moody, sophisticated backdrop that helps the text pop.
2025-05-27 06:44:37,946 - INFO -   
2025-05-27 06:44:37,946 - INFO -   Your main focus is a bold, elegant heading composed of three stacked words — "SVG," "Generation," and "Instructions" — all centered horizontally. They use the classic serif font Georgia, which adds a touch of refinement and readability. The warm, creamy text color (#f3deb5) contrasts nicely against the dark background, making the words stand out clearly. The largest font size (96px) and letter spacing emphasize importance and create breathing room.

Cascades of molten cheese, smoky BBQ sauce, and creamy aioli drip dynamically down the stack, their glossy textures catching dramatic rim lighting. Wisps of grilled onion smoke curl and diffuse around the composition, while scattered coarse sea salt crystals reflect subtle highlights. The tension between robust, charred textures and vibrant freshness is captured with sharp contrasts and bold angularity."

2025-05-27 06:49:19,649 - INFO -   "Against a profound deep black (#000000) backdrop, a soft, golden pav bun floats mid-air, dramatically tilted forward to showcase the vibrant, layered core within. The crispy, spiced potato vada gleams with a subtle sheen, enriched by a smear of vibrant green chutney (#4CAF50) and a tangy tamarind sauce (#A0522D). Fresh coriander leaves (#3B7A57), translucent thin onion slices, and a burst of snow-white grated coconut dynamically spill outward, their organic forms captured in fluid mid-motion. Golden fried green chilies spiral energetically through the air, accompanied by a cascade of crunchy sev (#FFC107) and a precise drizzle of fiery garlic chutney (#D84315) caught mid-pour, each element defined by sharp highlights and textured shadows. Delicate puffs of chaat masala and coarse rock salt crystals float like aromatic bursts, adding sensory depth. Floating alongside, a miniature tawa (flat griddle) spins mid-flip, scattering sizzling garlic tadka and caramelized onions with dramatic motion blur and glossy reflections. The ultra-fast shutter speed effect combined with dramatic rim and key lighting sculpts the textures and layers, transforming this classic Indian street food into a spectacular explosion of indulgence, complexity, and contemporary culinary artistry."

2025-05-27 06:55:18,764 - INFO -   An ultra-creamy, ivory-hued cheesecake slab rests on a matte slate plate, edges perfectly smooth, radiating a luscious, velvety glow under soft, directional lighting. The dense, buttery graham cracker crust peeks beneath, golden-brown and crumbly, anchoring the ethereal top layer. A glossy, ruby-red cherry compote pools lazily at the base, with plump, glistening cherries cascading over one side. Delicate wisps of vanilla bean cream curl and swirl atop, punctuated by a fine dusting of powdered sugar that catches the light like fresh snow. The composition is minimalist yet decadent, emphasizing the pure, indulgent texture and the harmonious contrast of tart and sweet—captured with a shallow depth of field to draw the viewer’s eye to the cheesecake’s silky surface and the jewel-like cherries.

The dense, buttery graham cracker crust anchors the composition with warm golden-brown hues, visible along the base’s sharp edge. Glossy pools of ruby-red cherry compote spill languidly to one side, with plump cherries bursting with glossy sheen, as delicate wisps of vanilla bean cream curl upward in airy spirals. A fine dusting of powdered sugar sparkles subtly like the first snowfall, suspended mid-air to suggest freshness. The shallow depth of field isolates the cheesecake’s silky texture and jewel-like garnishes, transforming the classic dessert into an indulgent, minimalist spectacle of flavor and refinement.

2025-05-27 07:08:08,916 - INFO -   An epic, slow-motion capture of a towering gourmet burger suspended mid-air against a matte charcoal backdrop. The toasted brioche bun, brushed with melted butter, hovers slightly askew, exposing the succulent, flame-grilled beef patty layered with melted sharp cheddar. Crisp lettuce leaves ripple outward, interwoven with tangy pickles, sweet caramelized onions, and a glossy smear of house-made smoky chipotle mayo. Juices glisten from a slice of ripe tomato as thin ribbons of smoky bacon curl dynamically through the air. A sprinkle of crushed black pepper and sea salt crystals float like confetti, adding tactile depth. The composition is framed with subtle golden highlights and deep shadows to amplify the robust, indulgent nature of this American classic, inviting the viewer into a sensory feast of flavor and craftsmanship.

The thick, flame-grilled beef patty gleams with juices, wrapped in molten sharp cheddar that oozes downward. Crisp, bright green lettuce leaves ripple outward, intertwining with glossy smoky chipotle mayo smeared generously across the bun's underside. Tangy pickles and sweet caramelized onions scatter dynamically, while thin ribbons of smoky bacon curl through the air like savory smoke rings. Juicy tomato slices glisten with droplets, and a shower of crushed black peppercorns and flaky sea salt crystals cascade like edible confetti.

2025-05-27 07:27:08,519 - INFO -   Creating an effective "Coming Soon" poster involves several key design considerations. Here’s a breakdown of design knowledge tailored to your plan:

1. **Design Principles and Guidelines**:
   - **Simplicity**: Keep the design clean and uncluttered to ensure the message is clear and easily understood.
   - **Balance**: Distribute visual elements evenly throughout the poster to create a harmonious look.
   - **Alignment**: Ensure that all elements are aligned properly to guide the viewer's eye through the information.
   - **Contrast**: Use contrasting colors and font weights to highlight important information, like the "Coming Soon" headline.

2. **Color Theory Recommendations**:
   - **Complementary Colors**: Select colors that complement each other to create visual interest without overwhelming the viewer. For example, pairing blue (trust) with a vibrant green (growth) can evoke positive feelings.
   - **Emotional Impact**: Consider the psychological effects of colors. Blue can convey professionalism, green suggests innovation, and white symbolizes clarity and simplicity.
   - **Color Proportions**: Use one dominant color, a secondary color for accents, and a neutral color (like white or light gray) to balance the design.

3. **Typography Suggestions**:
   - **Headline Font**: Opt for a bold, sans-serif font like Montserrat or Lato to ensure visibility and a modern feel. The larger the headline, the more attention it will draw.
   - **Body Font**: Use a clean sans-serif font such as Open Sans or Roboto to maintain legibility. Ensure the font size is adequate for reading from a distance.
   - **Font Weight Variations**: Utilize different weights (e.g., bold for the headline, regular for the tagline, and light for contact details) to create a clear visual hierarchy.

4. **Layout Best Practices**:
   - **Z-Pattern Layout**: Arrange elements so that the viewer's eye naturally follows a Z-shaped pattern, starting from the headline at the top, moving to the logo, then to the tagline, and finishing with the call to action.
   - **Whitespace**: Incorporate ample whitespace around elements to prevent overcrowding and enhance readability.
   - **Focal Point**: Ensure that the "Coming Soon" headline is the first thing people see by placing it at the top and making it the largest element.

5. **Visual Hierarchy Tips**:
   - **Size and Scale**: Make the most important information (like the "Coming Soon" message) the largest. The tagline should be smaller, but still prominent enough to catch attention.
   - **Color and Contrast**: Utilize colors to create emphasis. For instance, the headline could be in a bright color against a darker background.
   - **Grouping**: Group related information (like the tagline and launch date) together to help viewers process information in chunks.

6. **Technical Requirements**:
   - **Resolution**: Ensure all images and graphics are high-resolution (at least 300 DPI) for print quality.
   - **File Formats**: Prepare both print and digital versions of the poster. Use PDF for print and PNG or JPG for social media sharing. 
   - **Adaptability**: Design with versatility in mind, allowing for easy adjustments to different formats without losing quality.

7. **Industry Standards and Trends**:
   - **Minimalism**: Current design trends favor minimalistic approaches that convey messages clearly and effectively.
   - **Dynamic Graphics**: Consider incorporating modern graphic trends such as gradients or subtle textures to add depth without cluttering the design.
   - **Mobile Optimization**: Given the prevalence of mobile devices, ensure that any digital versions of the poster are optimized for viewing on smaller screens.

By following these guidelines, you can create a visually appealing and effective "Coming Soon" poster that generates excitement and communicates key information about your startup.
