1. Scheduling
Purpose:
Yeh step ensure karta hai ki poora shooting process time-wise optimize ho – location, cast, crew, set-ups, aur timing sab cheezein proper tarike se manage ho.

Process in Depth:

Script Parsing & Scene Identification:
AI tool (jaise ki Filmustage ya custom NLP model) sabse pehle script ko parse karta hai. Yeh process har scene ko identify karta hai.
Example:

Scene 1: "Krish and Ananya’s first meeting in IIM Ahmedabad mess hall"

Scene 2: "Family discussion in Chennai about the cultural differences"
Yeh scenes ko tag karta hai with metadata like location, required cast, estimated shoot duration, indoor/outdoor, time of day (morning, afternoon, night).

Day-Wise Breakdown:
Ab AI scheduling module har scene ko shooting days mein divide karta hai.
Detailed Example:

Day 1:

Location: IIM Ahmedabad

Scenes:

Scene 1: Meeting in mess hall (Estimated 4 hours: Setup, shoot, breakdown)

Scene 3: Campus walk shot (Estimated 3 hours)

Cast & Crew:

Cast: Krish, Ananya

Crew: Director of Photography (DoP), Lighting, Sound, Makeup, etc.

Call Sheet Generation:

AI generates a digital call sheet with exact timings (e.g., Call Time: 8 AM, Breakfast at 8:30 AM, Scene 1 from 9-1 PM, Lunch break, Scene 3 from 2-5 PM, wrap by 6 PM).

Additional Features:

Filter Options: Users can filter shooting days by location, scene complexity, actor availability, aur weather (important for outdoor shots).

Contingency Planning: AI includes buffers (extra 30 minutes per scene) for delays.

Resource Optimization & Conflict Resolution:

Agar same actor ya location multiple scenes mein required hain, AI reschedules with minimal travel and downtime.

Real-time Adjustments: Agar koi scene delay ho jata hai, system automatically updates subsequent schedules aur notifies team members via integrated calendar apps.

User Interface (UI) Aspect:

Dashboard View:
Har shooting day ka ek detailed card milega jisme scene number, location, timings, cast list, and notes (like “Night Shoot” ya “Requires special lighting”).

Interactive Filters:
Option to view by day, location, or cast, aur drag-and-drop rescheduling available.

2. Budgeting
Purpose:
Budgeting module yeh ensure karta hai ki har scene, day, aur resource ka cost estimate accurately generate ho aur overall production cost track ho.

Process in Depth:

Data Integration with Scheduling:
AI budgeting tool (jaise ki Rivet AI) scheduling module se har scene ka breakdown leta hai.
Example:

For Day 1 (IIM Ahmedabad):

Location Charges: Rental fees for campus shooting, permits, etc.

Cast/Crew Fees: Based on standard day rates, overtime rules.

Equipment Rental: Cameras, lighting, sound kits for the duration.

Miscellaneous: Catering, transportation, contingency.

Detailed Cost Estimation:

AI calculates cost on a per-scene basis.

Each scene gets a line-item budget:

Scene 1 Budget:

Location: ₹20,000

Cast: ₹15,000 (2 actors, standard day rate)

Crew: ₹25,000

Equipment: ₹10,000

Misc: ₹5,000

Total for Scene 1: ₹75,000

Day-Wise & Aggregate Budgeting:

After calculating per-scene budgets, the system aggregates to a day-wise total.

Filtering Options:

Users can filter budgets by category (location, talent, equipment) or by shooting days.

What-if Scenarios:

AI allows modifications; e.g., if a scene is rescheduled to an evening shoot, cost for lighting might increase by a certain percentage, and the tool automatically updates the budget.

UI Integration:

Interactive Budget Sheets:

Dashboard displays dynamic spreadsheets, with options to drill down by scene or day.

Alerts & Recommendations:

Suggestions for cost optimization (e.g., "Consider combining Scene 2 and Scene 4 to cut transportation costs").

3. One-Liner Creation
Purpose:
Har scene ko ek concise summary mein convert karna taa ki production team ko quick recall aur context mil sake.

Process in Depth:

Script Analysis using NLP:

AI tool (ChatGPT-based solution) script ke har scene ko analyze karta hai aur ek single, crisp one-liner generate karta hai.
Example:

Scene 1 One-Liner: "Krish meets Ananya in a bustling mess hall, sparking an unexpected connection."

Scene 2 One-Liner: "Cultural tensions rise as families clash over traditions in Chennai."

Usage:

These one-liners are integrated into call sheets, daily briefs, aur storyboards.

Easy filtering: Users can search for a scene using keywords from the one-liner.

UI Aspect:

Sidebar Summaries:

Each scene card in the scheduling dashboard includes its one-liner for quick reference.

4. Character Breakdown
Purpose:
Detailed profiles for har ek character, jo poore film ka emotional aur narrative thread banate hain.

Process in Depth:

Extraction & Analysis:

AI scans the dialogue, scene descriptions, and narration to extract character details.

Attributes Generated:

Name, Age, Appearance: E.g., "Krish Malhotra – 25, smart, confident, with a casual yet culturally-influenced wardrobe."

Role & Trait: E.g., "Protagonist, witty but sensitive, representing a bridge between cultures."

Screen Time: Percentage of scenes, key transformation moments.

Example Profiles:

Krish Malhotra:

Screen Count: Appears in 85% of scenes.

Arc: Starts as a carefree student, matures into a dedicated partner.

Ananya Swaminathan:

Screen Count: 75% of scenes.

Arc: Balances modern aspirations with cultural legacy.

Dynamic Data Integration:

Har scene ke baad, AI update karta hai ki character ne kya reaction diya, kin emotions ko reflect kiya, etc.

Yahan par analytics help karegi director aur actor ko role depth samajhne ke liye.

UI Aspect:

Profile Dashboard:

Har character ke profile card par details, emotional keywords, aur scene timeline available honge.

Filtering Options:

Can filter characters based on their involvement in a particular day or scene, role significance, etc.

5. Storyboarding (With Previs Elements)
Purpose:
Visualize each scene in a sequence of static images or rudimentary animations, jo aage jaake detailed previsualization (previs) mein evolve hoti hai.

Process in Depth:

Scene-to-Image Generation:

AI tool (jaise ki StoryboardHero, MidJourney, ya custom-trained Stable Diffusion models) script ke har scene ka detailed visual representation banata hai.

Detailed Example for Scene 1:

Description: "Mess hall in IIM Ahmedabad – bustling ambience, colorful student crowd, subtle lighting highlighting the first interaction between Krish and Ananya."

Parameters:

Camera Angle: Medium close-up of the two main characters.

Mood & Lighting: Bright morning light, natural shadows; emphasis on emotional expressions.

Elements: Background details like tables, mess hall decor, chatter, etc.

Output: A series of panels depicting key moments:

Panel 1: Wide shot of the mess hall establishing the setting.

Panel 2: Close-up on Krish’s expression as he notices Ananya.

Panel 3: Reaction shot of Ananya, indicating curiosity and slight hesitation.

Integrating Previs Elements:

Animation Touch:

Once static storyboards mil jate hain, advanced tools like Kling 2.0 or Runway Gen-4 Alpha take these images and add minimal animations – character movements, camera pans, transition effects – to produce a rough animatic.

Timing & Transitions:

AI calculates transition durations, camera cuts, and syncs dialogue snippets (if available) for a dynamic preview of the scene flow.

UI Aspect:

Storyboard Viewer:

A window or module dedicated to storyboarding jahan har panel ke saath timestamp, shot description, aur zoom-in/zoom-out options available hon.

Feedback Loop:

Director can annotate directly on the storyboard panels (e.g., “Change angle here” or “Adjust lighting intensity”), and AI can incorporate these changes in real time.

Filtering & Customization:

Users can choose between different artistic styles (realistic, stylized, comic-book style) and even generate multiple variations to decide the best fit.

Export Options:

Final storyboards and animatics can be exported as PDF, video, or interactive presentations for further discussion in team meetings.

Integration Across the Platform
Imagine the entire workflow integrated into a single dashboard:

Step 1 (Script Ingestion): Upload the PDF/script.

Step 2 (Automated Breakdown): AI outputs scene list, character profiles, and metadata.

Step 3 (Scheduling Module):

A calendar view jahan har shooting day ka detailed plan (location, cast, timings) dikh raha ho.

Filters available for "Location", "Time", "Cast", etc.

Interactive call sheets generate automatically, with options to add notes or adjust timings on the fly.

Step 4 (Budgeting Module):

Linked directly to the scheduling data, showing day-wise cost breakdowns, resource allocation, aur what-if scenario comparisons.

Step 5 (Storyboarding & Previs):

Scene-by-scene visual panels generated on the fly.

Option to animate these panels into a rough animatic using advanced AI like Kling 2.0.

Director/crew feedback is integrated directly on the dashboard for iterative refinement.

Practical Use-Case Recap (2 States as Example)
Script Upload:

Hum "2 States" ka script upload karte hain; AI automatically break karta hai har scene aur details nikalta hai.

Detailed Scheduling:

Suppose AI determines 40 shooting days.

Day 1: IIM Ahmedabad mess hall shooting (Scene 1, Scene 4) – detailed breakdown including exact hours (8 AM to 6 PM), cast list, and setup notes.

Day 2: Campus walkthrough, additional scenes – similar detailed plan.

AI ensures har day ke liye call sheets, adjustment options, aur real-time alerts (if koi delay ho).

Budgeting Integration:

Every shooting day ke liye cost calculation ho raha hai – location fees, actor fees, equipment, etc.

Filters allow checking per category costs, aur overall budget summary updated dynamically.

One-Liners and Character Profiles:

Har scene ke summary aur detailed character breakdowns system se accessible – jisse director ko overall narrative clarity milti hai.

Storyboarding:

For each key scene, AI generates visual panels with detailed descriptors (camera angles, lighting, expressions) and even rough animatics for dynamic previews.

Director can iterate through different storyboard styles before finalizing the look.

Final Thoughts
Yeh poora system ek integrated platform ke through chal raha hoga jahan saare modules ek doosre se linked hain. AI ke advanced NLP, computer vision, aur scheduling algorithms se ek seamless pre-production workflow tayar hota hai jo conventional methods se bahut efficient hai. Is detailed approach mein koi bhi chhota element miss nahi hota – from daily minute-by-minute scheduling to final animated storyboards.

Agar tumhe aur koi specific detail chahiye ya koi aur module (jaise budgeting mein deeper filters, ya scheduling ke contingency plans) discuss karna hai, toh batao. Main is process ko aur bhi detail mein further refine kar sakta hoon.
